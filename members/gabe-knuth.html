    <p>Gabe Knuth is an independent industry analyst, blogger, and speaker, known throughout the world as “the other guy” at BrianMadden.com. He has been nearly 100% focused on desktops, applications, and devices throughout his 16 year career in IT, a journey that has taken him from help desks, to data centers, to the cloud as a consultant, in-house IT person, and as an analyst. As evidenced by his co-authorship of the book The VDI Delusion, Gabe’s focus tends to lean more toward practical, real-world uses for technology, essentially boiling off the hype and examining the actual usefulness of each technology in specific use cases. Gabe has written for BrianMadden.com and SearchVirtualDesktop.com since 2007, and has spoken at major industry trade shows such as BriForum and Citrix Synergy</p>
