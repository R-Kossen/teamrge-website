    <p>Over time I became the technical lead at Hewlett-Packard in EMEA for Client Virtualization solutions where I evaluated and presented the newest and upcoming technologies working closely or being part of the VDI engineering team at HP in Houston before I moved to NVIDIA to work on NVIDIA GRID. At NVIDIA I started as a Senior GRID Solution Architect in Central Europe and then moved to the GRID Business Unit where we work with partners like Citrix, Microsoft, Red Hat and VMware on current and upcoming technologies to change the way people work.</p>
