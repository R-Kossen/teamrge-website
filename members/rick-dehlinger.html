    <p>As a technologist and business athlete, Rick has worn many hats over his 20+ years in the industry, but at the end of the day, his passion lies in designing and building ‘stuff’. In this (perhaps inappropriately informal) context, ‘stuff’ is a broad reference, ranging from businesses to products/platforms, relationships to cloud systems, markets to satisfying user experiences.</p>
    <p>Rick is  a career learner and a student of Agile frameworks and customer centric design – an empathetic, creative type who enjoys thinking big and going where none has gone before. He embrace leadership roles with conviction and a sense of responsibility, and Rick get great satisfaction out of nurturing people and inspiring them to greatness.</p>
